**Why the “Silver Guide”?**

<a name="2" style="font-weight:normal;">We</a> have selected the shortened title Silver Guide to evoke the notion of money without having to give the full title (The Silver Guide to Non-Monetary Transactions). The title also aims at situating this work within the wider suite of resources produced by ARCA, such as The Grey Guide to Artist-Run Publications and Circulation, as well as those produced by the RCAAQ in its series of red, blue, orange, and green “Petits Guides.”

**Why account for non-monetary transactions?**

In most financial arrangements, an organization that requests public funding must report its own contribution to the overall financing of its activities. Typically, funding agencies will finance only part of the organization’s programming and thus usually require that a percentage be obtained via other sources. For example, in the case of an internship or employment program, expenses related to fixed costs (rent, insurance, etc.), supervision, and workstation may be covered under the organization’s core funding. But when, in applying for core funding, an organization is required to demonstrate that a percentage of its overall support comes from other sources, it is assumed that it has access to other levels of public funding, to reduce its dependence on a single agency.

Looking at the funding provided by arts councils at the provincial level, however, not all provinces <a name="3" style="font-weight:normal;">are</a> equal: in 2019–20, average funding for artist-run centres by the Ontario Arts Council was just $32,611, compared to those supported by the Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec, which averaged $142,705.

To bridge such great disparities in provincial (and municipal) funding, some organizations must take advantage of all the opportunities available through their partnerships. Converting non-monetary contributions received into book value can help them reach the percentage required to qualify for funding.

**How to determine the fair market value of non-monetary transactions?**

The fair market value (FMV) of **donated** goods or services is based on the normal sale price established by the donor organization at the time when the goods/services are given.

The FMV of goods or services **received** is established by the donating party based on the sale price that would normally be charged to the client/partner organization.

Since the transaction is non-monetary in nature, FMV is defined here as a payment amount agreed upon by willing parties in the normal course of business and on a level playing field, such as the retail sale price for local or online commerce.

However, FMV valuation is not an exact science and there is no universal scale. Adequate, reliable, and reasonable valuation is essential when accounting for gifts and barter of non-monetary services in financial statements.

Fair market valuation may vary from one organization to another, depending on various market parameters: visibility, reputation, profitability, scarcity, duration of event, print run, etc.

FMV may fluctuate over time, as it is established at the time of the transaction.

Parties engaged in a non-monetary transaction must be able to justify their valuation method to the tax authorities. Your Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) can help you determine a valuation method and explain what supporting documentation is required.

Below are three methods that can guide you in this process.

***Comparison Method***
This method is based on transactions of comparable goods or services. To be considered as comparable, transactions must be carried out in a similar sector of activity, under similar socio-geographical conditions, and at a relatively recent date.

For example, the price of a donated good or service may be compared against prices in requested quotations, against earlier purchases, or by comparing with prices offered by competitors in the same sector of activity. The method of comparison must also be contextualized, as this may vary even within the same sector.

In this regard, factors that may influence FMV may include notoriety in the case of an exchange with a highly visible event with extensive media coverage and documented attendance statistics, or scarcity such as an artwork or other collectible item.

***Cost Method***
This method is based on the cost of a good or service (i.e., the cost of its manufacture).

In the case of goods, this method involves determining the replacement cost as of the current date, under the assumption that the actual cost reflects the market cost (i.e., the FMV). This method is similar to those used by insurance companies to determine the replacement cost of goods.

In the case of services, all indirect expenses incurred in the provision of the service must be taken into consideration (e.g., management costs, salaries or fees, telecom or utility costs, insurance, etc.). Evaluation of these indirect expenses makes it possible to estimate the true cost of the service and to evaluate that cost against market rates.

It may be the case that the estimated cost ends up being higher than the market price. For example, if the cost of renting a gallery space was $5,000 per month, even as an equivalent space was available on the market for $2,000, the FMV may be reasonably justified by what is or is not included (e.g., technicians, bar service, caretaker, <a name="4" style="font-weight:normal;">insurance</a>, furniture, equipment, etc.).

***Expert Evaluation***
In cases of extraordinary or luxury assets (e.g., land, buildings, collectibles, works of art), it may be appropriate to call upon an independent professional third party. You can also set up a committee of experts or peers who can establish evaluation criteria.

**How to record non-monetary transactions in your accounting system?**

Please consult section 3 of the Silver Guide to determine in advance whether the value of non-monetary transactions relating to goods or services can be recorded in your financial statements. If it can, please continue reading.

For all organizations and businesses, revenues and expenses for the fiscal year must appear in the financial statements, in the “statement of operations” document. Subtracting the expenses from the revenues will yield either a deficit or a surplus (also called a profit).

In cases of non-monetary transactions of goods or services received as gifts or via barter, it is important to properly record these in the financial statements so as not to generate a false profit or a false deficit.

For example, suppose your organization receives a printer ink cartridge for free, with a market value of $175. The FMV of such a good or service received constitutes a revenue.
When recording this non-monetary transaction in the accounting system, the $175 should therefore be recorded in a revenue line item. The organization does not hold the $175 in cash: it is simply the market value of the ink cartridge. Further, by the fiscal year-end, the ink cartridge has been used and is empty.

It is important to remember that the third requirement when accounting for a gift is that it be something that the organization would otherwise have had to purchase (see section 2 of the Silver Guide). It is therefore an office supply expense that is covered, in this example, by receipt of the free cartridge. For this reason, it is important also to enter the market value of the ink cartridge in an expense line item, in return for the donation received. Thus, through the symmetry of the accounting system, the false profit effect is cancelled out.

In order to represent financial information accurately in the financial statements, and to follow accounting standards, revenue items must be presented separately under appropriate categories, such as sponsorships and bartered services, non-monetary transactions, or in-kind contributions.

As for expenses, these may be presented separately or incorporated into the existing statement of accounts, depending on your organization’s practices. Your CPA can help you with such accounting operations.
