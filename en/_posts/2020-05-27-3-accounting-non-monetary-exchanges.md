In this section, we will focus on exchanges of goods and services. Once again, the main issue in recognizing these transactions lies in their proper valuation.

Generally speaking, these transactions are assessed at the fair value either of the goods or services received or the goods or services supplied—**whichever is more accurate**.

To account for these non-monetary exchanges, it is important to ensure that the assessment of fair value is sufficiently reliable. If the fair value is not sufficiently reliable, do not record it.

{% include nav_yes_no.html
question="Is the established fair value of the exchange sufficiently accurate?"
answer = 1
yes = ""
no = "Do not record transaction in financial statements."
