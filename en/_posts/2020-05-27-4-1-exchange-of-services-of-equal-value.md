These examples illustrate the importance of producing an invoice and accounting for each transaction to ensure that the organization is handling taxes correctly.

**Example - QST in Québec:** A charitable organization enters into an agreement with an artist-run centre in Québec (registered to charge sales tax) for an exchange of services of equal value. The charitable organization will lend one of its spaces to the artist-run centre in exchange for the use of the artist-run centre’s equipment. The value of the exchanged services is established at $1,000. No money is exchanged.

The provision of space by the charitable organization is an exempt supply. As a result, no taxes should be collected by the charity. However, the rental of equipment by the artist-run centre is considered a taxable service, and as the centre is registered for taxes, it must collect and remit taxes on the FMV of the exchanged services, which, in this example, equals $50 for GST (5% of $1,000) and $99.75 for QST (9.975% of $1,000). For the charity, since it is only entitled to a 50% rebate on the GST and QST, this will result in a cost of $74.88, or 50% of the GST ($50) and QST (99.75).

**Example - HST in Ontario:** A theatre company in Ontario that is a charity, and not registered for HST, agrees to an exchange with an artist-run centre. The artist-run centre is a non-profit, and an HST registrant filing on the commercial method. The theatre will provide an advertisement in its program, worth $500, in exchange for the rental of the artist-run centre’s projection equipment, also worth $500.

The artist-run centre has to charge 13% HST on the $500 value of the rental. So, in addition to the exchanged value, the theatre must pay the artist-run centre $65 HST (13% of $500) in cash. The artist-run centre will remit that HST to the CRA.

As a registered charity, the theatre can claim back a portion of the HST by filing a Public Service Bodies Rebate. They can claim back 82% of the 8% provincial portion of the HST ($32.80) and 50% of the 5% federal portion of the HST ($12.50), for a total rebate of $45.30. The remaining $19.70 in HST is an expense for the theatre company.
